# Installation

Ensure npm is installed.

From the /static directory, run

`npm install`

to pull your dependencies.

Ensure gulp is installed globally by running

`npm install gulp -g`

so we have access to the gulp CLI.

# Building

Simply run

`gulp`

to compile and minify SCSS and JS.  Build files are output to the /static/build dir.

You can also run

`gulp watch`

to auto-compile when files are changed.
